# agendaCreator 

Planning tool for a new semester. 
The loop will create a number of similar agendas i mardown format.

Idea: genrate the markdown agendas via the loop. Fill in the lesson details.
Add bibliographies.

At the end of the semester creating a compiled version with literature and other sources will be relatively easy.

* agenda - improved by Occam's razor to a oneliner.
* loop - the first version with cunning loops.
